I am Megha Kalia, a PhD candidate at University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver, Canada, who is working towards an ambitious goal of building an Augmented Reality/ Mixed Reality (AR/MR) system for Robot Assisted Surgery (RAS) and test it on human patients within the duration of my PhD. I work with a fantastic interdisciplinary team of clinicians, radiologists, engineers and researchers from Vancouver General Hospital (VGH), UBC and Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany.

I work at [Robotics and Control Lab][RCL], Vancouver and am supervised by [Prof. Tim Salcudean][TIM] from UBC and [Prof Nassir Navab][NAVAB] from Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany. My research lies at the intersection of human perception inspired AR/MR, human computer interaction, computer vision and perception in robotics. Out of all these topics human perception inspired AR/MR with the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is closest to my heart.

I received my Master of Technology (M.Tech) from Indian Institute ofTechnology (IIT), Kharagpur, India in Medical Imaging and Informatics. During my masters, I got DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) scholarship to spent 7 months at [Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures & Augmented Reality (CAMPAR)][CAMPAR], TUM under the supervision of Prof. Nassir Navab to finish my thesis. I received the Govt. of India AICTE fellowship for the whole duration of my masters.

Thanks to our great interdisciplinary collaborations, I have won awards like [Public Scholars Initiative][PSI], have been in [UBC press][UBC PRESS] and have received an Outstanding Paper Award.

Currently, I am part of the steering committee of [Biomedical Imaging and Artificial Intelligence Research Cluster][BIAIRC], UBC. In the past, I have served as a member of Graduate Council Student Caucus, UBC and as an executive committee member, Women in Engineering, UBC.

When I am not working you can find me either running, biking, or reading some book. Fun fact: In my PhD I have managed to read more than 60 fiction/non-fiction books so far.
