        I am Megha Kalia, a research assistant and PhD candidate at University
        of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver, Canada, who is working towards an
        ambitious goal of building an Augmented Reality/ Mixed Reality (AR/MR)
        system for Robot Assisted Surgery (RAS) and test it on human patients
        within the duration of my PhD.

      <p>
        I work at a
        <a href="http://rcl.ece.ubc.ca/people/">Robotics and Control Lab</a>,
        Vancouver and am supervised by
        <a href="http://ece.ubc.ca/~tims/">Prof. Tim Salcudean</a> from UBC and
        <a href="http://campar.in.tum.de/Main/NassirNavabCv"
          >Prof Nassir Navab</a
        >
        from Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany. I research on the
        topics of computer vision, perception in robotics, human computer
        interaction and human perception inspired AR/MR. Out of all these topics
        human perception inspired AR/MR with the application of Artificial
        Intelligence (AI) is closest to my heart.

        I received my Master of Technology (M.Tech) from Indian Institute of
        Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, India in Medical Imaging and Informatics.
        During my masters, I got DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service)
        scholarship to spent 7 months at
        <a href="http://campar.in.tum.de/WebHome"
          >Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures & Augmented Reality
          (CAMPAR)</a
        >, TUM under the supervision of Prof. Nassir Navab to finish my thesis.
        I received the Govt. of India AICTE fellowship for the whole duration of
        my masters.

        In my current role, I am fortunate to have a fantastic interdisciplinary
        team in Robotics and Control Lab, Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) and
        Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany, working together towards
        making AR/MR for RAS a reality. What makes us stand-out is our decades
        long excellent collaboration with
        <a href="https://www.prostatecentre.com/about-us/people/dr-peter-black"
          >Dr Peter Black</a
        >, a Urologist at VGH, who has tested many of our techniques during
        robotic prostate surgeries at VGH. Such past paced execution of methods
        from inception to implementation in surgery has kept me hooked over the
        years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to our great interdisciplinary collaborations, I have won awards
        like

        >
        and have received an Outstanding Paper Award.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am part of the steering committee, UBCâ€™s
        <a href="https://bmiai.ubc.ca/"
          >Biomedical Imaging and Artificial Intelligence Research Cluster</a
        >. In the past, I have served as a member of Graduate Council Student
        Caucus, UBC and as executive committee member, Women in Engineering,
        UBC.

        When I am not working you can find me either running, biking, or reading
        some Tolstoy masterpiece.
