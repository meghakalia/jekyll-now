      <p>
        I am Megha Kalia, a PhD candidate at University of British Columbia
        (UBC), Vancouver, Canada, who is working towards an ambitious goal of
        building an Augmented Reality/ Mixed Reality (AR/MR) system for Robot
        Assisted Surgery (RAS) and test it on human patients within the duration
        of my PhD.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work at [Robotics and Control Lab][RCL], Vancouver and am supervised
        by [Prof. Tim Salcudean][SALCUDEAN] from UBC and [Prof Nassir
        Navab][NAVAB] from Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany. I
        research on the topics of computer vision, perception in robotics, human
        computer interaction and human perception inspired AR/MR. Out of all
        these topics human perception inspired AR/MR with the application of
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is closest to my heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        I received my Master of Technology (M.Tech) from Indian Institute of
        Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, India in Medical Imaging and Informatics.
        During my masters, I got DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service)
        scholarship to spent 7 months at [Chair for Computer Aided Medical
        Procedures & Augmented Reality][CAMPAR] (CAMPAR), TUM under the
        supervision of Prof. Nassir Navab to finish my thesis. I received the
        Govt. of India AICTE fellowship for the whole duration of my masters.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my current role, I am fortunate to have a fantastic interdisciplinary
        team in Robotics and Control Lab, Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) and
        Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany, working together towards
        making AR/MR for RAS a reality. What makes us stand-out is our decades
        long excellent collaboration with [Dr Peter Black][BLACK], a Urologist
        at VGH, who has tested many of our techniques during robotic prostate
        surgeries at VGH. Such past paced execution of methods from inception to
        implementation in surgery has kept me hooked over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to our great interdisciplinary collaborations, I have won awards
        like [Public Scholars Initiative][PSI], have been in [UBC
        press][UBC_PRESS] and have received an Outstanding Paper Award.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am part of the steering committee, UBCâ€™s [Biomedical
        Imaging and Artificial Intelligence Research Cluster][BIAIRC]. In the
        past, I have served as a member of Graduate Council Student Caucus, UBC
        and as executive committee member, Women in Engineering, UBC.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I am not working you can find me either running, biking, or reading
        some Tolstoy masterpiece.
