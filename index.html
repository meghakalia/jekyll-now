        I am Megha Kalia, a PhD candidate at University of British Columbia
        (UBC), Vancouver, Canada, who is working towards an ambitious goal of
        building an Augmented Reality/ Mixed Reality (AR/MR) system for Robot
        Assisted Surgery (RAS) and test it on human patients within the duration
        of my PhD.

        I work at Robotics and Control Lab, Vancouver and am supervised by Prof.
        Tim Salcudean, from UBC and Prof Nassir Navab from Technical University
        of Munich, Germany. I research on the topics of computer vision,
        perception in robotics, human computer interaction and human perception
        inspired AR/MR. Out of all these topics human perception inspired AR/MR
        with the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is closest to my
        heart.

        I received my Master of Technology (M.Tech) from Indian Institute of
        Technology (India), Kharagpur in Medical Imaging and Informatics. During
        my master I got DAAD scholarship to carry out my thesis for 7 months at
        TeAAAAAA

        I am fortunate to have a fantastic interdisciplinary team in Robotics
        and Control Lab, Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) and Technical
        University of Munich (TUM), Germany, working together towards making
        AR/MR for RAS a reality. What makes us stand-out is our decades long
        excellent collaboration with Dr Peter Black, a Urologist at VGH, who has
        tested many of our techniques during robotic prostate surgeries at VGH.
        Such past paced execution of methods from inception to implementation in
        surgery has kept me hooked over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to our great interdisciplinary collaborations, I have won awards
        like Public Scholars Initiative and has also got one Outstanding Paper
        Award.

        When I am not working you can find me either running, biking, or reading
        some Tolstoy masterpiece.
