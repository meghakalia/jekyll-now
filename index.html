        I am Megha Kalia, a PhD candidate at University of British Columbia (UBC), 
        Vancouver, Canada, who is working towards an ambitious goal of building 
        an Augmented Reality/ Mixed Reality (AR/MR) system for Robot Assisted Surgery (RAS) 
        and test it on human patients within the duration of my PhD. I work with a 
        fantastic interdisciplinary team of clinicians, radiologists, engineers and 
        researchers from Vancouver General Hospital (VGH), UBC and Technical University 
        of Munich (TUM), Germany.

      <p>
        I work at 
        <a href="http://rcl.ece.ubc.ca/people/">Robotics and Control Lab</a>,
        Vancouver and am supervised by
        <a href="http://ece.ubc.ca/~tims/">Prof. Tim Salcudean</a> from UBC and
        <a href="http://campar.in.tum.de/Main/NassirNavabCv"
          >Prof Nassir Navab</a
        >
        from Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany. 
        My research lies at the intersection of human perception 
        inspired AR/MR, human computer interaction, computer vision 
        and perception in robotics. Out of all these topics human perception 
        inspired AR/MR with the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
        is closest to my heart.

        I received my Master of Technology (M.Tech) from Indian Institute of
        Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, India in Medical Imaging and Informatics.
        During my masters, I got DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service)
        scholarship to spent 7 months at
        <a href="http://campar.in.tum.de/WebHome"
          >Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures & Augmented Reality
          (CAMPAR)</a
        >, TUM under the supervision of Prof. Nassir Navab to finish my thesis.
        I received the Govt. of India AICTE fellowship for the whole duration of
        my masters.

        Currently, I am part of the steering committee of
        <a href="https://bmiai.ubc.ca/"
          >Biomedical Imaging and Artificial Intelligence Research Cluster</a
        >, UBC. In the past, I have served as a member of Graduate Council Student Caucus, 
        UBC and as an executive committee member, Women in Engineering, UBC.

        When I am not working you can find me either running, biking, or reading some book. Fun fact:
        In my PhD I have managed to read more than 60 fiction/non-fiction books so far.
