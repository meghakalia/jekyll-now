  <p>
    In the paper we used a very intuitive idea of mapping distance between the
    surgical instrument to the color spectrum.

  <p>
    For evaluation we conducted a user study using a within subjects experiment
    design with 12 subjects. We evaluated CDE in both stereoscopic and monocular
    conditions. The four conditions are Stereo (S) + Color-Depth Encoding (CDE),
    Stereo + No CDE, No Stereo + CDE and No Stereo + No CDE. Results show
    significantly less error in depth judgements in Stereo + CDE case when
    compared to other cases. Subjects also took significantly less time in
    Stereo + CDE case. For details of the task please see the paper. The method
    can be seen in the video shown below.

      (Top) Normal endoscope camera image. (Bottom) Our CDE visualization with
      tumor (the small blob that is changing color) and the virtual surgical
      instrument. The color of the tumor changes (from red to blue) as the
      distance of the surgical instrument from the tumor increases. For details
      please click on the title of the video.
